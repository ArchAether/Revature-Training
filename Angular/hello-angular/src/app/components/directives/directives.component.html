<h3>Direcitves</h3>
<h6>Angular <b>Directives</b> are special pre-built instructions
  that typically render HTML code or provide additional functionality</h6>
  <hr>
  <p>There are three types of directives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Custom Directives using the decorator <code>@Directive</code>.</b> - This is added to a TypeScript class. Furthermore, The @Component decorator is actually a special form of the @Directive decorator. In practice, you’ll use @Directive when creating your own custom directives. </li>
    <li><b>Structural Directives</b> - This will add/remove/or update the contents of the DOM. It basically changes the webpage’s layout. <code>*ngFor</code> and <code>*ngIf</code> which we’ll explain in a moment are common examples of structural directives. The following is a quick example of their usage. Again, we’ll dive deeper into their usage in a moment.  </li>
    <li><b>Attribute Directives</b> - The final form is an attribute directive. An attribute directive will change the look and feel or behavior of an element. Examples of attribute directives are <code>ngModel</code>, <code>ngClass</code>, and <code>ngStyle</code>. We cover ngModel in a separate video when we explain two-way data-binding. Here, you’ll see usage of ngClass.</li>
  </ul>
   <b>Structural Directive example *ngFor</b>
   <i><br>List of things that Genesis likes:</i>
   <ul>
     <li *ngFor="let thing of items">
       {{thing}} </li>
   </ul>

<h4>Display every employee in my list of employees, 
  and have different properties based on their role</h4>
  <ul *ngFor = "let e of employees" 
  [ngSwitch] = "e.role">                  <!--"'String'" need the single quotes to indicate string-->
    <li *ngSwitchCase = "'Trainer'"     
    class = "text-warning">{{e.name}} is a trainer</li>
    <li *ngSwitchCase="'Associate'"
    class="text-success">{{e.name}}</li>
  </ul>

<!-- <h4>Show all retro games:</h4>
<ol *ngFor = "let g of games"
  >
  <li [ngIf] = "g.releaseYear == 2000;">{{games}}</li>
</ol> -->

<button (click) = "toggle()">Click me?</button>

<h4 *ngIf="bool">This is an ngIf</h4>
