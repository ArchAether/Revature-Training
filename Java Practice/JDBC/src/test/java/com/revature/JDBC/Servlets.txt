container is where the application is stored.
.war 
1. client sends http request

2. Server recieves request. Generates ServletRequest, ServletResponse (Java objects)

3. Servlet container uses deployment descriptor to map request to appropriate servlet.
	- deployment descriptor tells how to deploy to web

4. Container instantiates the servlet. //Servlet lifecycle

5. container calls servlets init() method to set any parameters specifiesd in the D.D
	(Deployment Descriptor)

6. Container calls servlet's service() method to processs the request, 
		which invockes a request handler method

7. HTTPREsponse is retuned by servlet to server and then to client.
	- 6 and 7 continue untill it dies. see 8. lol

8. each successes request to sersver which maps to this servlet invokes service()

9. Container calls servlet's destroy() method. (releasing instance to save memory, 
active period for servlet has elapsed, or container could be shutting down)

use a Java logger that can log errors.
